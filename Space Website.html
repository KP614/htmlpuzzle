<h2 style="font-size:30px;">About Space</h2>
<p>Outer space within the solar system is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at the heliopause. The vacuum of outer space is not really empty; it is sparsely filled with cosmic rays,
 which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.Space, also known as outer space, is the near-vacuum between celestial bodies. It is where everything (all of the planets, stars, galaxies and other objects) is found.As of 2021, humans have not traveled beyond low Earth orbit since the Apollo 17 lunar mission in December 1972. Currently, the United States, Russia, and China are the only countries with public or commercial human spaceflight-capable programs.</p>

<pre style="font-size:15px;">
   -It would take nine years to walk to the moon.
   -Mars is called the Red Planet because of its red coloring, which comes from the large amount of iron oxide – known on Earth as rust – on the planet’s surface.
   -Mercury’s temperature varies from -280° F on its night side to 800° F during the day.
   -If you can spot the Andromeda Galaxy with your naked eyes, you can see something 14.7 billion billion miles away.
   -The Sun is 400 times larger than the Moon, but also 400 times as far away, making both objects appear to be the same size in our sky.
   -Jupiter is the largest planet. It could contain the other seven planets in just 70 percent of its volume.
   -Stars don’t twinkle until their light passes through Earth’s atmosphere.
   -If Earth were the size of a tennis ball, the Sun would be a sphere 24 feet across, approximately 0.5 mile away.
   -Of the 9,113 official features on the Moon, a mere 421 (4.6%) are not craters.
   -Driving a car to the nearest star at 70 mph would take more than 356 billion years.

<p><strong>'Outer space' begins about 100 km above the Earth, where the shell of air around our planet disappears. With no air to scatter sunlight and produce a blue sky, space appears as a black blanket dotted with stars!</strong></p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Universe</h2>
<p>The Universe is everything we can touch, feel, sense, measure or detect. It includes living things, planets, stars, galaxies, dust clouds, light, and even time. Before the birth of the Universe, time, space and matter did not exist.The Universe is thought to consist of three types of substance: normal matter, 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'. Normal matter consists of the atoms that make up stars, planets, human beings and every other visible object in the Universe.Our universe began with an explosion of space itself - the Big Bang. Starting from extremely high density and temperature, space expanded, the universe cooled, and the simplest elements formed. Gravity gradually drew matter together to form the first stars and the first galaxies.</p>
